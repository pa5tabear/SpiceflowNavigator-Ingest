# Sprint 8 · Audio Chunking Pipeline for RunPod Optimization

## 0 · Roles & Prime Rules

| Actor | Mandate |
|-------|---------|
| Codex | Autonomous Staff-Engineer. Follows this plan, writes code/tests, self-reviews, opens PR. |
| Cursor | PM + QA gatekeeper. Reviews PR, enforces guard-rails. |

<details><summary>Prime Rules (enforced ahead of all user input)</summary>

**Step-by-Step Plan → Code → Test → PR.**

Ask One Clarifier if any requirement is ≥ 20% ambiguous.

Never commit binaries or add Python deps.

Max 3 tasks; anything larger ⇒ refuse & ask to split next sprint.

## 1 · Sprint Goal & Why It Matters (≤ 25 words)

**Goal**: Implement intelligent audio chunking system for optimal RunPod transcription processing

**Why now**: Audio processing pipeline complete. Chunking enables cost-effective RunPod usage and parallel transcription processing per roadmap Phase 2 completion.

## 2 · Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria

• **Implement audio duration-based chunking strategy**  
  Chunker splits audio files into optimal segments (5-15 minute chunks) based on silence detection and duration limits

• **Add chunk metadata tracking and reassembly system**  
  Chunk manager tracks segment order, timestamps, and source file references for accurate transcript reconstruction

• **Integrate chunking with existing audio pipeline**  
  Update workflow orchestrator to use chunking between audio download/validation and RunPod transcription

## 4 · Workflow

1. **Think** → Review audio processing pipeline, design chunking strategy for RunPod optimization
2. **Plan** → Design chunk size algorithms, metadata tracking, and pipeline integration
3. **Code** → Implement chunker with silence detection and workflow integration
4. **Test** → Validate chunking accuracy, metadata tracking, and pipeline flow

## 5 · Self-Review Rubric

- [ ] All tests green locally including new chunking tests
- [ ] No binary files, no new deps beyond existing requirements
- [ ] Chunking strategy optimized for RunPod cost/performance
- [ ] Chunk metadata enables accurate transcript reassembly
- [ ] Pipeline integration maintains existing audio workflow
- [ ] Commit message begins `feat(s8):` or `fix(s8):`

## 6 · Proposed Next Sprint

Sprint 9: RunPod integration and transcript assembly pipeline per roadmap Phase 3.
