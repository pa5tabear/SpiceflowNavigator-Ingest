# Sprint 9 · RunPod Integration & Transcript Assembly Pipeline

## 0 · Roles & Prime Rules

| Actor | Mandate |
|-------|---------|
| Codex | Autonomous Staff-Engineer. Follows this plan, writes code/tests, self-reviews, opens PR. |
| Cursor | PM + QA gatekeeper. Reviews PR, enforces guard-rails. |

<details><summary>Prime Rules (enforced ahead of all user input)</summary>

**Step-by-Step Plan → Code → Test → PR.**

Ask One Clarifier if any requirement is ≥ 20% ambiguous.

Never commit binaries or add Python deps.

Max 3 tasks; anything larger ⇒ refuse & ask to split next sprint.

## 1 · Sprint Goal & Why It Matters (≤ 25 words)

**Goal**: Complete transcription pipeline with RunPod integration and chunk reassembly system

**Why now**: Audio processing (Phase 2) complete. RunPod integration enables actual transcription capability, completing core pipeline per roadmap Phase 3.

## 2 · Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria

• **Fix RunPod client environment configuration and integration**  
  Resolve persistent test failure, implement proper environment variable handling, enable RunPod transcription calls

• **Implement transcript assembly from chunked audio segments**  
  Assembler reconstructs full transcripts from chunk results, maintains timestamps, handles chunk ordering

• **Complete end-to-end pipeline integration**  
  Full workflow RSS→download→validate→chunk→transcribe→assemble→deliver with queue management

## 4 · Workflow

1. **Think** → Analyze RunPod test failure, design transcript assembly strategy
2. **Plan** → Design environment fix, assembly logic, and full pipeline integration
3. **Code** → Implement RunPod fixes, transcript assembler, and pipeline completion
4. **Test** → Verify 100% test pass rate and end-to-end transcription capability

## 5 · Self-Review Rubric

- [ ] All tests green locally including fixed RunPod test
- [ ] No binary files, no new deps beyond existing requirements
- [ ] RunPod integration functional with proper environment handling
- [ ] Transcript assembly accurate with chunk ordering and timestamps
- [ ] Full pipeline operational from RSS to delivered transcripts
- [ ] Commit message begins `feat(s9):` or `fix(s9):`

## 6 · Proposed Next Sprint

Sprint 10: Content enrichment and downstream delivery agents per roadmap Phase 4.
