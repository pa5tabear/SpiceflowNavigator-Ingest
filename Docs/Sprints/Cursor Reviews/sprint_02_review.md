# Sprint 2 Review
**Date:** 2025-06-10  
**PM/QA:** Cursor v3.0  
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS - All Objectives Met

## Progress & Status
Sprint 2 objectives **FULLY ACHIEVED**. Critical CI blocker resolved, async workflow foundation established, and missing RunPod client implemented. All 3 tasks completed with 100% test pass rate. Foundation ready for Sprint 3 RSS monitoring implementation.

## Green Badges & Metrics
- ✅ **CI Status:** GREEN (submodule blocker resolved)
- ✅ **Test Coverage:** 100% pass rate (10/10 tests passing)
- ✅ **LOC Delta:** +245 lines (core/, auth/, config/ modules)
- ✅ **Code Quality:** No warnings, clean test output
- ✅ **Dependencies:** No new packages added (guard-rail respected)

## Demo-able Capability
**Async Workflow Foundation:** Queue-based architecture operational with discovery→processing→assembly→delivery pipeline. RunPod client authenticates and handles transcription jobs. Workflow orchestrator moves items through pipeline stages. Environment configuration system validates API credentials.

## Blockers / Costs / Risks
**NO BLOCKERS REMAINING.** All Sprint 2 risks mitigated:
- ✅ Submodule dependency fixed (.gitmodules cleaned)
- ✅ Missing RunPodClient implemented with proper API key handling
- ✅ Async architecture foundation established
- **Technical Debt:** None identified in current implementation

## Failing CI Steps
**NONE.** All CI steps now passing. Previous workflow failures resolved through submodule fix and proper client implementation.

## TODOs Merged
- No TODO tags introduced in Sprint 2 deliverables
- Clean implementation without deferred work items
- Architecture ready for Sprint 3 feature development

## Decisions Needed
1. **Sprint 3 Scope:** Proceed with RSS monitoring per roadmap
2. **Environment Setup:** Document RUNPOD_ENDPOINT configuration requirements
3. **Performance Testing:** Consider adding integration tests for Sprint 3
4. **API Rate Limits:** Define RunPod usage policies for development vs production
