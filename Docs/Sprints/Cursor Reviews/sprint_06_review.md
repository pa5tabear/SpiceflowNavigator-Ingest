# Sprint 6 Review
**Date:** 2025-06-10  
**PM/QA:** Cursor v3.0  
**Status:** ❌ NOT EXECUTED - No Progress Made

## Progress & Status
Sprint 6 **NOT EXECUTED**. No commits, no deliverables, no progress since Sprint 5 completion. Audio processing pipeline remains unimplemented. Concurrent download, validation, and file management objectives not delivered by autonomous engineer.

## Green Badges & Metrics
- ❌ **CI Status:** UNKNOWN (gh CLI issues persist)
- ❌ **Test Coverage:** 92% pass rate (12/13 tests) - UNCHANGED
- ❌ **LOC Delta:** 0 lines (no new audio processing code)
- ❌ **Sprint 6 Deliverables:** None completed
- ❌ **Audio Components:** Download, validation, file management missing

## Demo-able Capability
**NO NEW CAPABILITY.** Same state as Sprint 5 review. Audio processing pipeline unimplemented. Users cannot download or validate audio content for transcription processing. RSS content remains stuck at discovery phase.

## Blockers / Costs / Risks
**PATTERN ESCALATION:** Second consecutive sprint non-execution
- **Root Cause:** Sprint plan not implemented by autonomous engineer
- **Process Risk:** Sprint 4 + Sprint 6 non-execution pattern emerging
- **Roadmap Impact:** Phase 2 audio processing blocked, Sprint 7 chunking cannot proceed
- **Technical Debt:** Test failure persisting 3+ sprints without resolution

## Failing CI Steps
**Same Test Failure:** `tests/clients/test_runpod_client.py::test_async_transcribe`  
**Error:** `ValueError: RUNPOD_ENDPOINT not set`  
**Duration:** 3+ sprints, persistent environment configuration issue

## TODOs Merged
- No code changes made to audit
- Audio processing TODOs not added

## Decisions Needed
1. **URGENT:** Escalate repeated sprint non-execution pattern to Project Owner
2. **PROCESS:** Review autonomous engineer capability and execution blocking factors
3. **ROADMAP:** Consider Phase 2 scope reduction or alternative implementation strategy
4. **SPRINT 7:** Combine audio processing objectives or pause development
