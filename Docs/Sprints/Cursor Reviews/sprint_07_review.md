# Sprint 7 Review
**Date:** 2025-06-10  
**PM/QA:** Cursor v3.0  
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS - Audio Processing Pipeline Delivered

## Progress & Status
Sprint 7 **SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED**. Complete audio processing pipeline delivered via PR #5. All 3 core deliverables implemented: concurrent audio downloader, file validation system, and temporary file management. This breaks the non-execution pattern from Sprints 4 & 6.

## Green Badges & Metrics
- ✅ **Test Coverage:** 94% pass rate (16/17 tests) - UP from 92%
- ✅ **LOC Delta:** +4 new files, ~120 lines of audio processing code
- ✅ **New Components:** audio/downloader.py, audio/validator.py, audio/file_manager.py
- ✅ **Sprint Execution:** Autonomous engineer successfully followed plan
- ✅ **Audio Pipeline:** Download, validation, cleanup system operational

## Demo-able Capability
**NEW CAPABILITY:** Audio content processing pipeline now functional. Users can:
- Download audio files with configurable concurrency limits (semaphore-based)
- Validate audio metadata (duration, format, bitrate) using ffprobe integration
- Automatic temporary file management with cleanup
- Queue-integrated workflow ready for RunPod transcription

## Blockers / Costs / Risks
**PERSISTENT ISSUE:** Same test failure continuing
- **Test:** `test_async_transcribe` environment configuration 
- **Impact:** 1/17 tests failing, but not blocking main workflow
- **Duration:** 4+ sprints, requires targeted fix in Sprint 8

## Failing CI Steps
**Same Test Failure:** `tests/clients/test_runpod_client.py::test_async_transcribe`  
**Error:** `ValueError: RUNPOD_ENDPOINT not set`  
**Resolution Needed:** Test environment setup for RunPod client instantiation

## TODOs Merged
- Audio processing pipeline components delivered
- Concurrency controls implemented
- File validation system operational
- Temporary file cleanup automated

## Decisions Needed
1. **NEXT PHASE:** Audio chunking implementation ready for Sprint 8
2. **TEST FIX:** Prioritize persistent RunPod test environment resolution
3. **VALIDATION:** Full audio→transcription pipeline integration testing
