# Sprint 4 Review
**Date:** 2025-06-10  
**PM/QA:** Cursor v3.0  
**Status:** ❌ NOT EXECUTED - No Progress Made

## Progress & Status
Sprint 4 **NOT EXECUTED**. No commits, no deliverables, no progress since Sprint 3 review. RSS monitoring components remain missing, test failures persist unchanged. Recovery plan provided but not implemented by Codex.

## Green Badges & Metrics
- ❌ **CI Status:** UNKNOWN (gh CLI issues persist)
- ❌ **Test Coverage:** 90% pass rate (10/11 tests) - UNCHANGED
- ❌ **LOC Delta:** 0 lines (no new code delivered)
- ❌ **Sprint 4 Deliverables:** None completed
- ❌ **RSS Components:** Still missing from Sprint 3

## Demo-able Capability
**NO NEW CAPABILITY.** Same state as Sprint 3 review. RSS monitoring pipeline, content deduplication, and queue integration remain unimplemented. Test failure blocks async transcription functionality.

## Blockers / Costs / Risks
**CRITICAL ESCALATION:** Sprint 4 complete non-execution
- **Root Cause:** Sprint plan not implemented by autonomous engineer
- **Compound Risk:** Sprint 3 + Sprint 4 deliverables both missing
- **Roadmap Impact:** Sprint 5 blocked, full 10-sprint plan at risk
- **Technical Debt:** Test failure accumulating, environment config broken

## Failing CI Steps
**Same Test Failure:** `tests/clients/test_runpod_client.py::test_async_transcribe`  
**Error:** `ValueError: RUNPOD_ENDPOINT not set`  
**Duration:** 2+ sprints, no resolution attempt

## TODOs Merged
- No code changes made to audit
- Previous TODOs remain unaddressed

## Decisions Needed
1. **URGENT:** Escalate Sprint 4 non-execution to Project Owner
2. **PROCESS:** Review autonomous engineer execution capability
3. **ROADMAP:** Consider major scope reduction or timeline extension
4. **SPRINT 5:** Combine Sprint 3+4+5 objectives or halt development
